    <abstract>
        <t>
            RPL allows different mode of operations which allows nodes to have
            a consensus on the basic primitives that must be supported to join
            the network. The MOP field in RFC6550 is of 3 bits and is fast
            depleting.  This document extends the MOP field specification and
            adds a notion of capabilities using which the nodes can further
            advertise their support for, possibly optional, capabilities.

    <section title="Introduction">
        <t>
            RPL <xref target="RFC6550"/> specifies a proactive distance-vector
            based routing scheme. The protocol creates a DAG-like structure
            which operates with a given "Mode of Operation" (MOP) determining the
            minimal and mandatory set of primitives to be supported by all the
            participating nodes.
        </t>
        <t>
            MOP as per <xref target="RFC6550"/> is a 3-bit value carried in DIO
            messages and is specific to the RPL Instance. The receipient of the
            DIO message can join the specified network as a router only when it
            can support the primitives as required by the mode of operation
            value. For example, in case of MOP=3 (Storing MOP with multicast
            support) the nodes can join the network as routers only when they
            can handle the DAO advertisements from the peers and manage routing
            tables. The 3-bit value is already exhausted and requires
            replenishment. This document introduces a mechanism to extend mode
            of operation values.
        </t>
        <t>
            This document further adds a notion of capabilities using which the
            nodes in the network could inform its peers about its additional
            capabilities/features. This document highlights the differences of
            capabilities from that of Mode of operation and explains the
            necessity of it.

                <t>
                    MOP extension. Current MOP of 3-bit is fast depleting. An
                    MOP extension needs to extend the possibility of adding new
                    MOPs in the future.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Backwards compatibility. The new options and new fields in
                    the DIO message should be backward compatible i.e. if there
                    are nodes which support old MOPs they could still operate
                    in their own instances.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Optional capabilities handshake. Capabilities are features,
                    possibly optional, which could be handshaked between the
                    nodes and the root within an RPL Instance.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Capabilities handshake could be optionally added with
                    existing MOPs. Capabilities been optional in nature could
                    be put to use with existing MOPs. Capabilities and
                    MOP-extension is mutually independent i.e. a DIO can have a
                    capabilities option, MOP-extension option or both in the
                    same message.

                An implementation supporting this document MUST calculate the

                6.3.1. of <xref target = "RFC6550"/>) plus the MOPex value.
                Thus if the MOPex value is 0, it means the final MOP is 7 since

            <t>
                If the MOPex option is absent in the DIO whose MOP is 7, then
                the MOPex value can be assumed to be zero (thus the final MOP
                in this case will be 7). The MOPex value should be referred
                only if the base MOP value is 7 and if the MOPex option is
                present. In case the base MOP is 7 and if the MOPex option is
                present, then the implementation MUST calculate the final MOP
                after considering the value in MOPex.
            </t>
            <t>
                Note that <xref target="RFC6550"/> allows the node who does not
                support the received MOP to still join the network as a leaf
                node. This semantic continues to be true even in case of MOPex.

    <section anchor="cap-why" title="Capabilities">
        <t>
            Currently RPL specification does not have a mechanism whereby a
            node can signal the set of features that are available on its end.
            Such a mechanism could help the root to advertise its capabilities
            and in response also determine some advanced information about the
            capabilities of the joining nodes. The Mode of Operation field in
            RPL mandates the operational requirement and does not allow loose
            coupling of additional capabilities. This document defines
            Capabilities as additional features which could be supported by the
            nodes and handshaked as part of RPL signaling. Capabilities
            are embedded as RPL control message option as defined Section 6.7
            of <xref target = "RFC6550"/> in the base messages of DIO, DAO and
            DAO-ACK signaling.
        </t>
        <t>
            Note that capabilities and MOPex are mutually exclusive and it is
            possible for an implementation to support either or both of the
            options.

                The root node could advertise the set of capabilities it
                supports in the DIO message. A node could take advantage of the
                knowledge that the root supports a particular capability.
                Similarly a node could advertise its capabilities in the DAO
                message using the capability control message option defined in
                this document. Capabilities advertised by non-root nodes are
                strictly a subset of the capabilities advertised by the root.
            </t>
            <t>
                In storing MOP, the DAO message from the 6LR could contain
                multiple target options. The targets of the capabilities option
                are indicated by one or more Target options that precede the
                Capabilties Option. This handling is similar to the Transit
                Information Option as supported in Section 6.7.8. of <xref
                    target = "RFC6550" />.

        <t>
            The MOP-extension could cause 3-byte increase in memory in the
            RPL-Instance. The MOP field in the RPL-Instance needs to be
            upgraded to a 32 bit integer.
        </t>
        <t>
            <xref target = "RFC6550" />, it was possible to discard an
            unsupported DIO-MOP just by inspecting the base message. With this
            document, the MOPex is a different control message option and thus
            the discarding of the DIO message could happen after inspecting the
            message options.
        </t>
        <t>
            A node in storing MOP could independently construct a DAO message
            with target options containing its child/sub-childs. Thus with
            capabilities it needs to reconstruct the capabilities field as
            well. This may result in increase in the memory requirement on per
            routing-entry basis.

                IANA is requested to create a registry for the
                extended-MOP-value (MOPex). This registry should be located in
                TODO.  New MOPex values may be allocated only by an IETF
                review. Currently no values are defined by this document. Each
                value is tracked with the following qualities:
                <list style="symbols">

            <t>
                IANA is requested to create a registry for the
                Capabilities flags as described in <xref target="cap-why"/> of this document. This registry should be located in
                TODO.  New Capabilities flags may be allocated only by an IETF
                review. Currently no flags are defined by this document. Each
                value is tracked with the following qualities:
                <list style="symbols">
                    <t>Flag</t>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
        <t>
            The options defined in this document are carried in the base
            message objects as defined in <xref target = "RFC6550" />. The RPL
            control message options are protected by the same security
            mechanisms that protect the base messages.
        </t>
        <t>
            Capabilities flag can reveal that the node has been upgraded or is
            running a old feature set. This document assumes that the base
            messages that carry these options are protected by RPL security
            mechanisms and thus are not visible to a malicious node.

    <!-- References split into informative and normative -->

    <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
     1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
     2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
        (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

     Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
     If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
     directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
     with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
     filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->
